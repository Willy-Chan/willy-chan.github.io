## 💻 /tests/ command quick reference

<b>Running Sanity Checks (test_nvshmem.py)</b>

Note that there is a separate branch (cmake_dl_and_nvshmem_malloc_full_integration) that requires torchrun instead of the native pytest framework.

```Unix
pytest -svx --tb=short tests tests/test_nvshmem.py
```

<b>Running All-To-All Checks (test_all_to_all.py)</b>

```Unix
pytest -svx --tb=short tests tests/test_all_to_all.py::test_all_to_all_4_gpu
```

<b>Running Benchmark (bench_all_to_all.py)</b>

```Unix
python3 -m tests.bench_all_to_all
```

## 📈 Performance Study

### System Configuration

All of the below tests were run using the provided benchmark script on a DGX system with 8 H100 GPUs.

```Unix
name,                memory.total [MiB], driver_version, compute_cap
NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3,   81559 MiB,       535.216.03,       9.0
NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3,   81559 MiB,       535.216.03,       9.0
NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3,   81559 MiB,       535.216.03,       9.0
NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3,   81559 MiB,       535.216.03,       9.0
```

These are the performance results I measured on CoreWeave - the performance appears to be pretty much comparable for dispatch and combine on E=64, but E=256 the gap widens - this is likely the tradeoff of dynamic linking with nvshmem.

Interestingly, decreasing the number of GPUs to just 4 results in a larger performance gap - could be worth a further analysis of why.

## 📗 NVSHMEM Library

See this [note on NVSHMEM Bootstrapping vs Initialization](#note-on-bootstrapping-and-initialization) if you're curious about the differences and low-level details. See [why we separate host and device initialization](#but-why-separate-host-and-device-components) as well.

### libnvshmem Components

- **`libnvshmem_host.so`** - Contains the main NVSHMEM runtime, initialization logic, and host-side API functions (<u>Dynamically Linked</u>)
- **`libnvshmem_bootstrap_uid.so`** - Handles the bootstrapping process for establishing communication between PEs (<u>Dynamically Linked</u>)
- **`libnvshmem_device.a`** - Contains device-side CUDA kernels and functions that run on the GPU (<u>Statically Linked</u>)

## Host-Side vs Device-Side Initialization

#### Host Side

- Uses `libnvshmem_bootstrap_uid.so` and `libnvshmem_host.so` for bootstrapping and initialization respectively.
- Call `nvshmemx_hostlib_init_attr()` in C++ or `nvshmem.core.init()` from Python.

#### Device Side

- Uses `libnvshmem_device.a` - note this is a statically linked library!

<!-- If the device library were dynamically linked, you could end up with:
- Multiple NVSHMEM runtimes loaded in the same process
- Conflicting memory management and communication state
- Undefined behavior when different components try to initialize the same resources -->

- You need to call `nvshmem_init()` (NOT a `nvshmemi_check_state_and_init_d()` which claims to initialize the device-side runtime but does not) before doing a `nvshmemx_collective_launch()` from Python.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(pplx_kernels PUBLIC
    nvshmem::nvshmem_host              # dynamic (.so)
    nvshmem::nvshmem_bootstrap_uid     # dynamic (.so)
    nvshmem::nvshmem_device            # static (.a)
)
```

## 🔌 Integration Points

<!-- ### NEED TO EXPLAIN THE FULL TRACE OF ALL 5 FILES SO THEY CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT I CHANGED: NEED TO ADD A PICTURE SHOWING THE FULL TRACED OUT STACK -->

### Python API

- **Initialization**: Use NVSHMEM4py's `nvshmem.core.init()` for host-side setup. [Here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvshmem/api/examples/language_bindings/python/index.html?highlight=torchrun) is a great reference written by the NVSHMEM team with code examples going over how to bootstrap and initialize from python with the native bindings - it should have everything you need to get started.
- **Device Operations**: CUDA kernels can call NVSHMEM device functions directly

### C++ Bindings

- **Memory Management**: We no longer use the **`csrc/bindings/nvshmem.cpp`** C++ wrappers and instead directly call from the nvshmem4py python package. It handles tensor allocation and deallocation with `nvshmem.core.interop.torch.Tensor` and `nvshmem.core.interop.torch.free_tensor`, and `nvshmem.core.finalize`.

### Build System

- Properly links host and device components (dynamically linked to hostlib, statically linked to device)

# 📖 Appendix

## Note on Bootstrapping and Initialization

**Bootstrapping** is the process of establishing communication channels between all participating Processing Elements (PEs) in an NVSHMEM program, including details like broadcasting a unique ID to all PEs, establishing a map of which PEs are what ranks, information exchange to establish fast GPU-to-GPU RDMA communication (IB/RoCEv2/NVLINK), etc.

Note that this is all done by the <u>host</u> via an existing networking protocol like MPI/Sockets/whatever. The end goal is for GPUs to be able to send data to one another, but in order to do this the host needs to establish these basic handshakes and information-exchanges.

If bootstrapping is like scaffolding, **initialization** is the actual laying of the train lines. It's what enables a program like NVSHMEM to actually work: it handles setting up all of the objects/datastructures in device memory to establish a symmetric heap, coordinate shared memory, potentially setup NVLink Sharp, etc.

## But Why Separate Host and Device Components?

TODO: The static device library is stateless and contains only function implementations. By statically linking the device library, we avoid having two separate NVSHMEM runtimes trying to manage the same resources, and applications can JIT-link their own CUDA modules with NVSHMEM device functions without runtime conflicts. (NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS MORE)
