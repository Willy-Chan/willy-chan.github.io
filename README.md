## FAQs

1. How to unfold the collapsed _Education_ and _Experience_ sections?
   - If you want to disable the collapsing feature entirely, remove the corresponding `<div>` tags in `index.html`. You can find them by searching for `<!-- Collapse -->`.
   - If you want to keep the collapsing feature but want to show the sections by default, you can replace `<div class="collapse" id="more-content">` with `<div class="show" id="more-content">` in `index.html`. I made a template there for your convenience - just uncomment it.
